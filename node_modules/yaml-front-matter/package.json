Simply put, yaml front matter supports the same api as js-yaml (with some extras) so pay the [js-yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) page a little visit. One can access js-yaml in the command line by running `$ js-yaml` (note this will run the actual js-yaml parser and will not be able to parse input intended for yaml-front-matter).\n\n## API - v1.0.3\n\n### loadFront(string|buffer|file, [contentKey])\n\n    var yamlFront = require('yaml-front-matter')\n      , input = '---\\npost: title one\\n';\n        input += 'anArray:\\n - one\\n - two\\n';\n        input += 'subObject:\\n prop1: cool\\n prop2: two';\n        input += '\\nreg: !!js/regexp /pattern/gim';\n        input += '\\nfun: !!js/function function() {  }---\\n';\n        input += 'content\\nmore';\n        \n    var results = yamlFront.loadFront(input);\n    if (results) \n      console.log(results);\n    else\n      // provided text does not contain yaml.\n\n    \nthe above will produce the following in the console.\n\n    { post: 'title one',\n      anArray: [ 'one', 'two' ],\n      subObject: { obj1: 'cool', obj2: 'two' },\n      reg: /pattern/gim,\n      fun: [Function],\n      __content: '\\ncontent\\nmore' }\n\nThe above method returns `undefined` if the provided text does not contain yaml. \n      \nNote that the two instances of ---, one at the beginning of input and the other denoting the end of the yaml section, is a requirement for for yaml-front-matter. Any content after the second --- is optional and for this reason, yaml-front-matter can parse any input js-yaml can as long as the input is marked with --- at the beginning and the end.\n\nAll of the content after the second --- is grouped under the '__content' key. This behavor can be changed in the command line by passing in an argument to the -c flag. Or\n\n    var yamlFront = require('yaml-front-matter')\n      , input = '---\\ntitle: Title\\n';\n        input += '---\\n';\n        input += 'content\\nmore';\n        \n    console.log(yamlFront.loadFront(input, 'extras'));\n    \nwill produce\n\n    { title: Title,\n      extras: '\\ncontent\\nmore' }\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the tests first install the development dependencies:\n\n    $ npm install --dev\n    \nThen run\n\n    make test\n    \n## License\n\n### \n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Derek Worthen\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
